// Note: The VersionSelectionModal now contains all language search and version selection
// functionality in a single modal to avoid multiple modal conflicts.
// Previously separate modals (LanguageSearchModal, VersionSelectionFromLanguageModal)
// have been consolidated into views within the main modal.
