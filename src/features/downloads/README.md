# Downloads Feature

This feature provides comprehensive download management for the Bible app, including background downloads, progress tracking, and media file integration.

## Features

- **Background Downloads**: Downloads continue even when the app is in the background
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for all downloads
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed downloads
- **Media File Integration**: Automatic integration with local media files database
- **Batch Operations**: Support for downloading multiple files at once
- **Queue Management**: Priority-based download queue with pause/resume functionality

## Continue Downloads Functionality

The "Continue Download" feature has been enhanced to ensure **ALL** pending and failed downloads are processed:

### What it does:

1. **Retries ALL failed downloads**: Regardless of previous retry count, all failed downloads are retried
2. **Processes ALL pending downloads**: All pending and paused downloads are processed, not just a limited batch
3. **Resets retry counts**: Downloads that exceeded retry limits get a fresh start
4. **Batch processing**: Downloads are processed in batches to respect concurrent limits while ensuring all are handled

### Key improvements:

- **Complete processing**: No downloads are left behind due to batch size limits
- **Fresh retry attempts**: Failed downloads get their retry count reset for a new attempt
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logs show exactly what was processed
- **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates on batch processing progress

### Usage:

```typescript
// Get summary of what will be processed
const summary = backgroundDownloadService.getContinueDownloadsSummary();
console.log(
  `Will process ${summary.totalCount} downloads (${summary.pendingCount} pending, ${summary.failedCount} failed)`
);

// Continue all downloads
const result = await backgroundDownloadService.continueDownloads();
console.log(
  `Processed ${result.processedCount} downloads (${result.successCount} succeeded, ${result.failedCount} failed, ${result.retriedCount} retried)`
);
```

### UI Integration:

The UI automatically shows:

- Total count of downloads to be processed
- Breakdown of pending vs failed downloads
- Real-time progress updates
- Clear indication of what will happen when "Continue Download" is clicked

## Background Download Service

The `BackgroundDownloadService` manages all background download operations with the following key methods:

### Core Methods

#### `continueDownloads()`

Processes ALL pending and failed downloads:

- Retries all failed downloads (resets retry counts if needed)
- Processes all pending and paused downloads
- Returns comprehensive statistics

#### `processAllPendingDownloads()`

New method that processes ALL pending downloads in batches:

- Respects concurrent download limits
- Processes downloads in batches of `maxConcurrentDownloads`
- Ensures no downloads are left unprocessed

#### `retryFailedDownloads()`

Enhanced to retry ALL failed downloads:

- Resets retry counts for downloads that exceeded limits
- Adds all failed downloads back to the queue
- Provides fresh retry attempts

### Configuration

```typescript
// config.ts
export const downloadServiceConfig: DownloadServiceConfig = {
  maxConcurrentDownloads: 3, // Process 3 downloads at once
  retryAttempts: 3, // Default retry limit
  retryDelay: 1000, // Base delay between retries
};
```

## Persistent Download Store

The `PersistentDownloadStore` provides persistent storage for downloads with enhanced retry management:

### New Methods

#### `resetRetryCount(id: string)`

Resets the retry count for a specific download:

- Sets retry count to 0
- Clears last retry time
- Useful for giving failed downloads a fresh start

### Enhanced Methods

#### `updateDownload(id: string, updates: Partial<PersistentDownloadItem>)`

Enhanced to handle retry count resets and status updates.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Continue Downloads

```typescript
import { backgroundDownloadService } from './services/backgroundDownloadService';

// Continue all downloads
const result = await backgroundDownloadService.continueDownloads();
console.log(`Processed ${result.processedCount} downloads`);
```

### Get Summary Before Continuing

```typescript
const summary = backgroundDownloadService.getContinueDownloadsSummary();
if (summary.canContinue) {
  console.log(`Will process ${summary.totalCount} downloads`);
  await backgroundDownloadService.continueDownloads();
}
```

### Hook Usage

```typescript
import { useBackgroundDownloads } from './hooks/useBackgroundDownloads';

const { continueDownloads, getContinueDownloadsSummary, isProcessing } =
  useBackgroundDownloads();

const summary = getContinueDownloadsSummary();
const handleContinue = async () => {
  if (summary.canContinue && !isProcessing) {
    await continueDownloads();
  }
};
```

## Error Handling

The system provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Retry limits**: Configurable maximum retry attempts
- **Exponential backoff**: Increasing delays between retries
- **Fresh starts**: Reset retry counts for manual retry attempts
- **Detailed logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

## Performance Considerations

- **Batch processing**: Downloads are processed in configurable batches
- **Concurrent limits**: Respects system resource constraints
- **Memory efficient**: Processes downloads without loading all into memory
- **Background friendly**: Continues processing even when app is backgrounded

## Testing

The enhanced functionality can be tested by:

1. Creating multiple failed downloads
2. Creating multiple pending downloads
3. Clicking "Continue Download"
4. Verifying all downloads are processed
5. Checking logs for detailed processing information
