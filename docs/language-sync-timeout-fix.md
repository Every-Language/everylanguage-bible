# Language Sync Timeout Fix

## Problem

The Bible app was experiencing language sync timeout errors during onboarding and language data loading. The error message was:

```
ERROR: Language entities sync failed: {
  "name": "Error",
  "message": "Language sync timeout"
}
```

## Root Causes

1. **Insufficient timeout values**: Timeouts were set to 8-10 seconds, which was too short for slow network conditions
2. **No network connectivity checks**: Sync operations were attempted without verifying internet connectivity
3. **Large batch sizes**: Onboarding used batch size of 2000, which could be problematic on slow networks
4. **Inadequate retry logic**: Limited retry attempts with basic backoff strategy

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Timeout Values

- **Language Service**: Increased from 8s to 30s (`src/features/languages/services/domain/languageService.ts`)
- **Language Hierarchy**: Increased from 10s to 30s (`src/features/languages/store/slices/languageHierarchy.ts`)

### 2. Added Network Connectivity Checks

- Added network connectivity verification before sync operations
- Integrated `NetworkService.checkOnlineCapabilities()` to verify internet connectivity
- Provides clear error messages when network is unavailable

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- More specific error messages based on error type (timeout vs network vs other)
- Better user feedback with actionable error messages
- Graceful handling of network failures

### 4. Enhanced Retry Logic

- Increased max retries from 2 to 3
- Implemented exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Better retry condition checking

### 5. Optimized Batch Sizes

- Reduced onboarding batch size from 2000 to 1000 for better reliability
- Maintains performance while improving stability

### 6. Non-blocking Background Sync

- Language sync failures during onboarding don't block the entire process
- Background sync continues even if initial sync fails
- Better user experience during slow network conditions

## Files Modified

1. `src/features/languages/services/domain/languageService.ts`
   - Increased timeout from 8s to 30s
   - Added network connectivity check
   - Improved error messages

2. `src/features/languages/store/slices/languageHierarchy.ts`
   - Increased timeout from 10s to 30s
   - Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Better error handling and messages

3. `src/features/onboarding/services/OnboardingSyncService.ts`
   - Reduced batch size from 2000 to 1000
   - Added graceful handling of language sync failures

4. `src/shared/services/sync/language/LanguageSyncService.ts`
   - Added network connectivity check at sync start
   - Better error reporting for network issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Slow Network Testing**: Test on slow 3G connections or with network throttling
2. **Offline Testing**: Verify graceful handling when network is unavailable
3. **Timeout Testing**: Test with various network conditions to ensure 30s timeout is sufficient
4. **Retry Testing**: Verify retry logic works correctly with exponential backoff

## User Experience Improvements

- Users now get clear, actionable error messages
- Sync operations are more reliable on slow networks
- Onboarding process continues even if language sync fails
- Better feedback about network connectivity issues

## Future Considerations

1. **Adaptive Timeouts**: Consider implementing adaptive timeouts based on network conditions
2. **Progressive Sync**: Implement progressive sync for very large datasets
3. **Offline Mode**: Enhance offline mode capabilities for language data
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to configure sync preferences (timeout, retry count, etc.)
