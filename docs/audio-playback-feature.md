## Overview

The background downloads screen now includes audio playback functionality for completed audio file downloads. Users can play, pause, and resume audio files directly from the download cards.

## Features

### Audio File Detection

- Audio files are marked with a small audio icon (ðŸŽµ) next to the filename

### Play Controls

- **Play Icon**: Appears on completed audio downloads
- **Play/Pause Toggle**: Click to play or pause the audio
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Playing audio files have a green border and green play icon
  - Paused audio files show a regular play icon
  - Non-audio files don't show play controls

### Integration with Media Player
