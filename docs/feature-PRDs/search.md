## Technical Implementation

### Search Engine Architecture

```typescript
interface SearchEngine {
  indexManager: SearchIndexManager;
  queryProcessor: QueryProcessor;
  resultRanker: ResultRanker;
  offline: boolean;
}

interface SearchQuery {
  text: string;
  type: 'reference' | 'content' | 'theme' | 'mixed';
  filters: SearchFilters;
  language: string;
  maxResults: number;
  includeRelated: boolean;
}

interface SearchFilters {
  books?: string[];
  testaments?: ('old' | 'new' | 'deuterocanonical')[];
  translations?: string[];
  languages?: string[];
  hasAudio?: boolean;
  contentTypes?: ('verse' | 'bookmark' | 'playlist' | 'note')[];
}

interface SearchResult {
  id: string;
  type: 'verse' | 'passage' | 'bookmark' | 'playlist';
  title: string;
  content: string;
  reference: VerseReference;
  score: number;
  highlights: TextHighlight[];
  translations: AlternativeTranslation[];
  hasAudio: boolean;
  metadata: SearchResultMetadata;
}
```

### Full-Text Search Implementation

```typescript
interface SearchIndex {
  // SQLite FTS5 for offline full-text search
  verseIndex: 'CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE verse_fts USING fts5(book, chapter, verse, text, translation)';

  // Custom indexing for multi-language support
  languageIndexes: Map<string, LanguageIndex>;

  // Reference parsing and normalization
  referenceParser: ReferenceParser;

  // Phonetic and semantic search indexes
  phoneticIndex: PhoneticIndex;
  conceptIndex: ConceptIndex;
}

interface LanguageIndex {
  stemmer: StemmerFunction;
  stopWords: string[];
  synonyms: Map<string, string[]>;
  scriptNormalizer: (text: string) => string;
}
```
