# Sync Feature PRD

## Overview

Robust offline-first synchronization system that seamlessly syncs user data across devices while maintaining full functionality without internet connectivity. Built on PowerSync and Supabase for reliable real-time sync with intelligent conflict resolution.

## Goals

- Provide seamless data synchronization across multiple devices
- Maintain full offline functionality with eventual consistency
- Handle sync conflicts intelligently with user control
- Optimize for unreliable network conditions and limited bandwidth
- Ensure data integrity and consistency across all platforms

## Key Features

### 1. Offline-First Architecture

- **Complete Offline Functionality**: All features work without internet connection
- **Local Data Storage**: Full Bible content and user data stored locally
- **Eventual Consistency**: Data syncs when connectivity is available
- **Conflict-Free Operation**: No dependency on network for core functionality
- **Smart Queuing**: Queue operations and sync when connection restored

### 2. Real-Time Synchronization

- **Live Updates**: Real-time sync when devices are online simultaneously
- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed data for efficiency
- **Background Sync**: Automatic sync in background without user intervention
- **Multi-Device Support**: Sync across unlimited devices per user account
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamless sync between iOS, Android, and future platforms

### 3. Intelligent Conflict Resolution

- **Automatic Resolution**: Smart algorithms for common conflict scenarios
- **User Choice**: User decides resolution for complex conflicts
- **Merge Strategies**: Intelligent merging of bookmark and playlist changes
- **Timestamp-Based**: Last-modified-wins with user override capability
- **Preview & Compare**: Show differences before applying conflict resolution

### 4. Selective Sync Control

- **Granular Control**: Choose what data types to sync (bookmarks, playlists, settings)
- **Storage Management**: Sync priority based on available storage
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Compress and optimize sync data for slow connections
- **Sync Scheduling**: Configure sync frequency and timing preferences
- **Pause/Resume**: Manual control over sync operations

### 5. Data Integrity & Recovery

- **Checksums & Validation**: Verify data integrity during sync operations
- **Backup & Restore**: Automatic backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Rollback Capability**: Undo problematic sync operations
- **Consistency Checks**: Regular validation of data consistency
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from failed or corrupted sync attempts

## Technical Implementation

### PowerSync Integration

```typescript
interface PowerSyncConfig {
  supabaseUrl: string;
  supabaseAnonKey: string;
  powersyncUrl: string;
  database: PowerSyncDatabase;
  uploadCrud: CrudUploadInterface;
  schema: AppSchema;
}

interface SyncableTable {
  id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  user_id?: string;
  device_id: string;
  sync_status: 'local' | 'synced' | 'pending' | 'conflict';
  version: number;
}

// Core syncable entities
interface SyncableBookmark extends SyncableTable {
  passage_reference: string;
  title: string;
  note?: string;
  highlight_color: string;
  folder_id?: string;
  tags: string[];
}

interface SyncablePlaylist extends SyncableTable {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  items: PlaylistItem[];
  is_public: boolean;
  category: string;
}

interface SyncableSettings extends SyncableTable {
  settings_json: string;
  category: string;
}
```

### Sync Rules & Permissions

```typescript
interface SyncRules {
  // User can only sync their own data
  bookmarks: 'SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE user_id = token.user_id';
  playlists: 'SELECT * FROM playlists WHERE user_id = token.user_id OR is_public = true';
  settings: 'SELECT * FROM user_settings WHERE user_id = token.user_id';

  // Anonymous users sync to device-specific data
  anonymous_bookmarks: 'SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE device_id = token.device_id AND user_id IS NULL';
}

interface ConflictResolutionStrategy {
  type: 'last_write_wins' | 'user_choice' | 'merge' | 'custom';
  handler: (local: any, remote: any) => any;
  requiresUserInput: boolean;
}
```

### Sync State Management

```typescript
interface SyncState {
  isOnline: boolean;
  isSyncing: boolean;
  lastSyncTime: Date | null;
  pendingOperations: PendingOperation[];
  conflicts: SyncConflict[];
  syncProgress: SyncProgress;
  errors: SyncError[];
}

interface PendingOperation {
  id: string;
  type: 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
  table: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  retryCount: number;
}

interface SyncConflict {
  id: string;
  table: string;
  recordId: string;
  localValue: any;
  remoteValue: any;
  conflictType: 'update_update' | 'update_delete' | 'delete_update';
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Network Optimization

- **Compression**: Gzip compression for all sync data
- **Delta Sync**: Only sync changed fields, not entire records
- **Batch Operations**: Group multiple operations into single requests
- **Connection Monitoring**: Detect network quality and adjust sync behavior
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for failed operations

## User Experience

### Transparent Sync

1. **Invisible by Default**: Sync happens transparently without user awareness
2. **Status Indicators**: Subtle indicators for sync status (synced, pending, offline)
3. **Progress Feedback**: Progress indicators for large sync operations
4. **Error Notification**: Non-intrusive notifications for sync issues
5. **Manual Trigger**: Optional manual sync trigger for impatient users

### Conflict Resolution Interface

1. **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection and notification of conflicts
2. **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Clear visual comparison of conflicting data
3. **Resolution Options**: Simple choices (keep local, keep remote, merge)
4. **Preview Changes**: Show what will happen before applying resolution
5. **Bulk Resolution**: Apply same resolution strategy to multiple conflicts

### Multi-Device Experience

1. **Device Management**: View and manage all synced devices
2. **Device Naming**: Custom names for easy device identification
3. **Selective Sync**: Choose which devices sync which data types
4. **Remote Wipe**: Security feature to remove data from lost devices
5. **Sync History**: View sync activity and changes across devices
