For the bible app, we need an MVP with the following features completed by July 15th, to send teams out for bible distribution in the himalayas:
•⁠ ⁠Media player, with verses
•⁠ ⁠⁠language selection to add to ‘my languages’, and automatic offline caching of my languages
•⁠ ⁠⁠independent selection of an audio language and text language from ‘my languages’
•⁠ ⁠⁠book selection with downloadable
•⁠ ⁠⁠analytics and auth (we need anon_users for analytics at the very least, would be nice to have auth.users set up too though)
•⁠ ⁠⁠generate versions of the app with a specific version of the bible pre-loaded, so we can share the app completely offline (eg. by transferring apk from an SD card)

in order of priority, here are the next features that should be completed after the MVP:
•⁠ ⁠settings
•⁠ ⁠⁠playlists (user created, and pre-defined)
•⁠ ⁠⁠bookmarks and bookmark folders, as well as text highlighting
•⁠ ⁠⁠sync to user account
•⁠ ⁠⁠user-selectable background music
