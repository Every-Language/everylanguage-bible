# CI/CD Pipeline & Testing Strategy

## CI/CD Architecture

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml                    # Main CI pipeline (PR checks)
├── cd-staging.yml           # Staging deployment
├── cd-production.yml        # Production deployment
├── security-scan.yml        # Security scanning
├── dependency-update.yml    # Automated dependency updates
└── performance-test.yml     # Performance testing
```

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Feature development branches
- **hotfix/***: Emergency production fixes
- **release/***: Release preparation branches

## CI Pipeline (ci.yml)

### Trigger Conditions
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Setup & Dependencies
- Node.js and npm/yarn setup
- Dependency caching
- Environment variable validation
- EAS CLI installation

#### 2. Code Quality Checks
- ESLint for code style
- Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript compilation
- Import organization validation

#### 3. Security Scanning
- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Semgrep for code security issues
- Secret scanning
- License compliance check

#### 4. Unit & Integration Testing
- Jest test execution
- Coverage report generation
- Test result publishing
- Coverage threshold enforcement

#### 5. Build Validation
- TypeScript compilation
- Metro bundler validation
- Asset optimization check
- Bundle size analysis

#### 6. Static Analysis
- SonarCloud code quality analysis
- Complexity metrics
- Technical debt assessment
- Maintainability scoring

## CD Pipeline - Staging (cd-staging.yml)

### Trigger Conditions
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Pre-deployment Validation
- All CI checks must pass
- Manual approval for deployment
- Environment configuration validation

#### 2. Build Generation
- EAS Build for iOS and Android
- Development build creation
- Build artifact storage

#### 3. Automated Testing
- E2E test execution on staging builds
- Performance testing
- Accessibility validation

#### 4. Staging Deployment
- TestFlight deployment (iOS)
- Internal testing track (Android)
- Staging environment database migration
- CDN content deployment

#### 5. Post-deployment Validation
- Health checks
- Smoke testing
- Analytics validation
- Notification testing

## CD Pipeline - Production (cd-production.yml)

### Trigger Conditions
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  release:
    types: [published]
```

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Release Preparation
- Version bump validation
- Changelog generation
- Release notes preparation
- Security sign-off requirement

#### 2. Production Build
- EAS Build for production
- Code signing
- Build optimization
- Asset compression

#### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Full E2E test suite
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Load testing simulation

#### 4. Gradual Deployment
- Canary deployment (5% of users)
- Monitoring and validation
- Gradual rollout increase
- Rollback capability

#### 5. Post-deployment Monitoring
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- User feedback collection
- Analytics validation

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- Local development setup
- Test database configuration
- Mock API endpoints
- Debug logging enabled

### Staging Environment
- Production-like configuration
- Staging database
- Limited analytics tracking
- Enhanced logging

### Production Environment
- Optimized configuration
- Production database
- Full analytics tracking
- Error monitoring

## Quality Gates

### Pull Request Requirements
- All CI checks must pass
- Code review approval (minimum 1 reviewer)
- Test coverage threshold met (80%)
- No security vulnerabilities
- Documentation updated

### Deployment Requirements
- All tests passing
- Security scan clean
- Performance benchmarks met
- Manual QA sign-off for major releases
- Rollback plan documented

## Developer Workflow

### Local Development
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run local test suite
4. Commit with conventional commit messages
5. Push and create pull request

### Code Review Process
1. Automated CI checks run
2. Peer review for code quality
3. Security review for sensitive changes
4. QA review for user-facing changes
5. Merge after all approvals

### Release Process
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Final testing and bug fixes
3. Version bump and changelog update
4. Merge to main for production deployment
5. Tag release and publish release notes
