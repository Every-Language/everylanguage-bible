# TanStack Query Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated `useVerses` and `useChapters` hooks from manual state management to TanStack Query, maintaining the same API and functionality while gaining the benefits of automatic caching, background refetching, and optimized performance.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/features/bible/hooks/useVerses.ts`

**Before**: Manual state management with `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`
**After**: TanStack Query with `useQuery` and `useMutation`

**Key Changes:**

- Replaced manual loading state with TanStack Query's `isLoading`
- Replaced manual error handling with TanStack Query's error handling
- Added automatic caching with `staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000` (5 minutes)
- Maintained all existing API methods: `selectVerse`, `getVerseRange`, `getAdjacentVerse`, `refreshVerses`
- Added `useVersesWithTexts` hook for fetching verses with their associated texts

**Benefits:**

- Automatic background refetching
- Built-in error handling and retry logic
- Optimized cache invalidation
- Reduced boilerplate code

### 2. `src/features/bible/hooks/useChapters.ts`

**Before**: Manual state management with complex `useEffect` chains
**After**: TanStack Query with multiple coordinated queries

**Key Changes:**

- Replaced manual chapter fetching with `useQuery`
- Added separate query for verses marked status
- Maintained all existing API methods: `selectChapter`, `clearSelection`, `fetchChapters`
- Preserved complex metadata computation with `useMemo`

**Benefits:**

- Automatic dependency management
- Parallel data fetching
- Optimized re-renders
- Simplified state management

## API Compatibility

Both hooks maintain **100% API compatibility** with their previous implementations:

### `useVerses(chapterId, filters?, sort?)`

```typescript
// Return type remains the same
{
  verses: Verse[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  selectedVerse: Verse | null;
  selectVerse: (verse: Verse | null) => void;
  getVerseRange: (startVerse: number, endVerse: number) => Promise<void>;
  getAdjacentVerse: (currentVerseNumber: number, direction: 'prev' | 'next') => Promise<Verse | null>;
  refreshVerses: () => void;
}
```

### `useChapters(bookId)`

```typescript
// Return type remains the same
{
  chapters: ChapterWithMetadata[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  selectedChapter: Chapter | null;
  fetchChapters: () => Promise<void>;
  selectChapter: (chapter: Chapter) => void;
  clearSelection: () => void;
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Automatic Caching**

- Verses are cached for 5 minutes
- Chapters are cached for 10 minutes
- Reduces redundant database queries

### 2. **Background Refetching**

- Data is automatically refreshed in the background
- UI remains responsive during updates
- Stale data is shown while fresh data loads

### 3. **Optimized Re-renders**

- TanStack Query only triggers re-renders when data actually changes
- Reduces unnecessary component updates

### 4. **Parallel Data Fetching**

- Chapters and verses marked status are fetched in parallel
- Faster overall data loading

## Query Key Strategy

### Verse Queries

```typescript
const verseQueryKeys = {
  all: ['verses'] as const,
  chapter: (chapterId: string) =>
    [...verseQueryKeys.all, 'chapter', chapterId] as const,
  chapterWithFilters: (
    chapterId: string,
    filters?: VerseFilters,
    sort?: VerseSort
  ) =>
    [...verseQueryKeys.chapter(chapterId), 'filters', filters, sort] as const,
  range: (chapterId: string, startVerse: number, endVerse: number) =>
    [
      ...verseQueryKeys.chapter(chapterId),
      'range',
      startVerse,
      endVerse,
    ] as const,
  withTexts: (chapterId: string, textVersionId?: string) =>
    [
      ...verseQueryKeys.chapter(chapterId),
      'with-texts',
      textVersionId,
    ] as const,
} as const;
```

### Chapter Queries

```typescript
const chapterQueryKeys = {
  all: ['chapters'] as const,
  book: (bookId: string) => [...chapterQueryKeys.all, 'book', bookId] as const,
  versesMarked: (chapterIds: string[]) =>
    [...chapterQueryKeys.all, 'verses-marked', chapterIds] as const,
} as const;
```

## Error Handling

Both hooks now benefit from TanStack Query's built-in error handling:

- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful error states
- Error boundaries integration
- Detailed error messages

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests in `src/features/bible/hooks/__tests__/useVerses.test.tsx`:

- Tests for loading states
- Tests for error handling
- Tests for data fetching
- Tests for both `useVerses` and `useVersesWithTexts` hooks

## Migration Impact

### Zero Breaking Changes

- All existing components continue to work without modification
- Same API surface maintained
- Same return types preserved

### Enhanced Functionality

- Better performance through caching
- Improved user experience with background updates
- More reliable error handling
- Reduced memory usage through optimized re-renders

## Future Enhancements

1. **Infinite Queries**: For large chapters, implement infinite scrolling
2. **Optimistic Updates**: For verse text updates
3. **Prefetching**: Preload adjacent chapters
4. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline-first capabilities

## Conclusion

The migration to TanStack Query successfully modernized the data fetching layer while maintaining full backward compatibility. The hooks now provide better performance, reliability, and developer experience without requiring any changes to consuming components.
